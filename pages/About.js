        Hi there, my name is Ashlie! After working in the legal industry as a
        legal assistant, I decided that law wasn&apos;t for me. I found it very
        boring and tedious and became underwhelmed quickly.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I am fun and creative (at least I like to think so), so I wanted
        something that matched this - something that challendged me whilst also
        being fun and creative.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Software development struck that balance for me!</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I did the Code First Girls Introduction into Web Development course and
        Introduction into Python Programming course which was my first taste of
        coding and I wanted more (greedy, I know)!
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This lead me to join the School of Code where I spent the last couple
        months on the bootcamp learning to code in order to finally kickstart my
        long awaited career in software development.
